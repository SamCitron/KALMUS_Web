## Getting Started

To start the application you must have two terminal windows open.
In the first, run:  

`npm start`  

This starts the React frontend side.

In the second, navigate to the `backend` folder and run:  

`pipenv shell`  
`python3 ./api.py`  

This starts the server side.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
